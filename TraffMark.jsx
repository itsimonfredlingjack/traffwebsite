/**
 * Träff's mark. Two marks, one form — the identity's hardest rule.
 *
 * `variant="brand"` is **A · Varumärket**: always complete, always monochrome.
 * Here the circle is a name. It says who is speaking, not what is true, which
 * is why it never carries a state colour — not green, not even in marketing.
 *
 * `variant="status"` is **B · Statusmärket**: empty until the proof exists. The
 * core is drawn in the same moment a passage has been verified verbatim, and
 * not a millisecond earlier. A filled core without a citation is a lie told in
 * the shape.
 *
 * The geometry is fixed (§02): the ring is 8 % of the outer diameter, the gap
 * is always empty — no tint, no gradient, it *is* the distance between the
 * question and the proof — and the core is 46 % of the inner measure, always
 * concentric, because a hit never sits off-centre.
 *
 * Below 16px the gap stops reading, and the identity says to use the solid dot
 * without a ring rather than a ring nobody can see.
 *
 * Accessibility (§01): the status mark is the primary visual state indicator
 * and never the only one. Every state carries its own text label in mono
 * elsewhere on screen; this component only ever contributes a label to the
 * accessibility tree.
